> * Recently, researchers have developed multi- instance learning algorithms to combat the noisy training data that can come from heuristic labeling, but their models assume relations are disjoint . for example they cannot extract the pair Founded(Jobs, Apple) and CEO-of(Jobs, Apple). This paper presents a novel approach for multi-instance learning with overlapping relations that combines a sentence-level extraction model with a simple, corpus-level component for aggregating the individual facts.
