> * Recently, researchers have developed multi- instance learning algorithms to combat the noisy training data that can come from heuristic labeling, but their models assume relations are disjoint . for example they cannot extract the pair Founded(Jobs, Apple) and CEO-of(Jobs, Apple). This paper presents a novel approach for multi-instance learning with overlapping relations that combines a sentence-level extraction model with a simple, corpus-level component for aggregating the individual facts.

> * Use syntactic constraints to specify relation phrases (3 simple patterns). Find longest phrase matching one of the syntactic constraints. 
> * Find nearest noun-phrases to the left and right of relation phrase. - Not a relative pronoun or WHO-adverb or an existential there.
> * To Avoid "overspecified" relation phrases, a relation phrase must have many distinct args in a large corpus
